# Box-Office-Sequel-Data
Sparked by an Online discussion a few years back centered around the questions of just how often theatrical sequels were able to outperform their predecessors, I began collating what is now to the best of my knowledge and ability, box office data on all the hollywood theatrical sequels released in the past 23 years. Box Office Values were sourced from Box Office Mojo - https://www.boxofficemojo.com/. The Spreasheet is Uploaded.

Here's some Charts I made to Visualize the data
